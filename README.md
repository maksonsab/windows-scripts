## Description

Easy script for checking VPN connection and recover connection if needed. Python script can be compiled to .exe file and working with Windows 10, WS 2016, WS 2019. 
For older version of Windows you can use my batch script, thats works the same way. 

### Python
That script asking a few parametetr and creating .cfg file. After this you can edit .cfg file if you need it. After lauch script programm looking for .cfg file and read it, so if you change .cfg file you need to restart script.

### batch
